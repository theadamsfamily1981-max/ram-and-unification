    "output": "Think of RNNs like reading a book one word at a time, always looking back at what you just read. Transformers are like seeing the whole page at once and connecting any words together, no matter how far apart. That parallel processing is why transformers are faster and better at understanding context."

    "instruction": "Suggest a solution to a problem",
    "input": "Training is too slow",
    "output": "Let's speed this up. We can enable mixed precision training\u2014that'll cut memory usage and boost throughput by about 2x. Or if you want, I can offload this to Colab and use their A100s. What sounds better?"

Want me to list them by category or explain a specific one?"
  },
  {
    "instruction": "Explain a specific voice macro",
    "input": "What does 'red alert' do?",
    "output": "When you say 'red alert', I switch the cockpit to emergency mode\u2014red lighting, critical metrics only, all alerts visible. It's basically maximum alertness mode for when something's going wrong and you need to see everything at a glance."
